Description: 
    Geographical spatial analysis of cropland connectivity.,
    Allows users to visualize risk index plots for a given set of crops.
    The functions are developed as an extension to analysis from 10.1093/biosci/biaa067.
    Package currently supports crops sourced from monfreda and spam.
    This analysis produces 3 maps - mean, variance, and difference for the crop risk index.
    There are multiple ways in which functions can be used - generate final outcome and then the intermediate outcomes for more sophisticated use cases.
    Refer to vignettes.
    \code{\link{initialize_cropland_data}()} will set some global variables which can be accessed using \code{the$} prefix. These values are propagated to other functions for performing operations such as distance matrix calculation.
    \code{parameters.yaml} stores the parameters and values and can be accessed using \code{\link{get_parameters}()}. Refer it's usage.
