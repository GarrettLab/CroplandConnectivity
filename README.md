# Global cropland connectivity
Here we provide the last version code template for conducting a global analysis of cropland connectivity.
Cropland connectivity follows the assumptions in Xing et al (2021) (https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/9/744/5875255). 
Since then, we have recently updated some of these assumptions and those are already incorporated in the current template here.
Data about global cropland of specific crops are publicly available in Monfreda et al (2008) (http://www.earthstat.org/harvested-area-yield-175-crops/ ) and MapSpam (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DHXBJX).
