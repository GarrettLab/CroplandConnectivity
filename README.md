# Global cropland connectivity

Here we provide the last version code template for conducting a global analysis of cropland connectivity. Cropland connectivity follows the assumptions in Xing et al (2021) (<https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/9/744/5875255>). Since then, we have recently updated some of these assumptions and those are already incorporated in the current template here. Data about global cropland of specific crops are publicly available in Monfreda et al (2008) (<http://www.earthstat.org/harvested-area-yield-175-crops/> ) and MapSpam (2005) (<https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DHXBJX>). Data of cropland in Subsaharan Africa is also available for 2017 (<https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FSSKBW>).

Data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) can also be used to construct a host landscape connectivity analysis. See the GBIF landscape code which transforms a georeferenced occurrence map (vector object) into host landscape density map (raster object).
